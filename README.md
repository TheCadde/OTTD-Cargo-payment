# OTTD-Cargo-payment
A "quick" tool that i threw together to help with making cargo profit calculations for a cargo override grf i've been working on for Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe.

This is a "pre-alpha" release. Meaning i won't really bother documenting it too much at the moment.
Basically, run it and cry when there's an unhandled exception. Or better yet, fiddle with it until it makes sense to you.

By the way, this application assumes you have OTTD's NML compiler in your environment path. It also assumes you have the willpower to figure it out. ;)
